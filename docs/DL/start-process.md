# start-process

<p class="callout info">**Requirements:**  
- **start-process.bat** *([see .bat](https://github.com/IMAG0D/Toolbox/tree/main/.bat))*</p>

Self-explanatory script. This script will start a process. There is a switch included after the process A1. This can be removed and only really applies if the developers have added selectable buttons and assigned switches. A1 is a common parameter which will select the first option and is typically the "Accept", "Run" or "Yes" button.
